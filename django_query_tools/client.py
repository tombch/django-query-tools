def combine_on_associative(operation, field1, field2):
    """
    Combine two pre-existing queries on an ASSOCIATIVE operation (`&`, `|`, `^`), and use this to reduce nested JSON.

    E.g. take the following query:

    `((X & Y) & Z) | (W & (X & (Y | (Z | X))))`

    We can use associativity of `&` and `|` to reduce how deeply nested the JSON request body is.

    By associativity of `&` and `|`, the following is unambiguous and logically equivalent to the previous query:

    `(X & Y & Z) | (W & X & (Y | Z | X))`

    With the former corresponding to more deeply-nested JSON than the latter.

    Believe it or not this is somewhat useful!! There is normally a limit on how deeply nested a JSON request body can be.

    So by preventing unnecessary nesting, users can programatically construct and execute a broader range of queries.
